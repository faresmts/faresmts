I'm currently graduating in Hardware and Software Engineering  and I've been working as an intern in back-end development since the third semester of the course, but even in that short time I acquired a good skill of PHP and Laravel with Eloquent, TDD and Docker. Also, I'm studying Design Patterns, SOLID, DDD, Clean Code and Clean Architecture and I have knowledge of front-end, design and low-level computing.

Today I see myself as a more mature professional, working very well under pressure, with good team relationships and squad engagement, I see myself as a team player. In addition, engineering brought me great power of critical and analytical thinking, problem solving, focus and dedication.

🔭 Enthusiast of web development technologies and embedded systems & IoT as a hobby.
