I'm currently graduating in Hardware and Software Engineering  and I've been working as an intern in back-end development since the third semester of the course, but even in that short time I acquired a good skill of PHP and Laravel with Eloquent, TDD and Docker. Also, I'm studying Design Patterns, SOLID, DDD, Clean Code and Clean Architecture and I have knowledge of front-end, design and low-level computing.

I was responsible for innovating and bringing good features into aiqfome, working most of the time developing a RESTful API with a large volume of requests. This brought me great challenges, from thinking about macro situations of great goals, going through creative and innovative solutions such as a PHP library that blocks bad words, to finally revitalizing tasks with incredible and differential features, such as a webhook within laravel for integration with API partners.

Today I see myself as a more mature professional, working very well under pressure, with good team relationships and squad engagement, I see myself as a team player. In addition, engineering brought me great power of critical and analytical thinking, problem solving, focus and dedication.
